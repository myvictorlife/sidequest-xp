This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.4.

## Configure psioniq File Header [LINK](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=psioniq.psi-header)

The psioniq File Header VSCode Extension will insert a header into the current document - either at the start of the document or at the current cursor position. The header can be configured globally and/or per language. However, the configuration separates the comment syntax from the template body so it is likely that a single template will be able to cover most languages.

    $ Configuration File: root/psioniq.json
